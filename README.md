# Audio-DeNoising-Using-Digital-Filters
 This project aims to separate the speech signal from a corrupted version of the same by random train noise. A voice signal is recorded while a train passes and the mixed audio signal is analysed in the frequency domain. The individual spectrums of a human voice signal and a train horn and trach noise are also analysed. Following, various filtering techniques are used to separate the speech signal from the corrupted mixed signal. An attempt is also made to enhance the output speech signal for maximum clarity.  The platform used for the implementation of the project is MATLABÂ©.
